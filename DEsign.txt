=rythmic racing game

-you control a CAR with a third person pov
-fixed speed going forward (to bpm)
-you can move side to side through lanes to avoid 
	obstacles(other cars, road blocks)
-you have x lives, and hiting an obstacle takes one life
-BOOSTS are taken before lives
-races are won when you come in first or are the last one standing

--mechanics--

-DODGING obstacles at the right moment grants you a BOOST
	-BOOSTs can push you one unit forward, or allow you to jump. 

-every racer emits a beam of light from their brakelights called the BOOSTCHAIN

2 possibilitiez:

cutting off an opponents BOOSTCHAIN (by moving/dodging through it) 
pushes them one unit back (to reconect their boost chain)

-or-

when you boost, you leave a boost chain that serves as an obstacle for other racers;
they must either boost through it or jump over (both requiring boosts)
 




car(controller): fixed speed forward, can be moved across x axis ( and y with jump)

camera: follows one unit behind, cam fov can see 3 lanes across
can be moved side to side to see over one lane



TODO:
_X_set up complete test track w collision (with LOD)
	_make gravity relative to track orientation (use normals?)

_set up car controller (move side to side + camera)
_X_have car move forward on track
_SET UP FORWARD MOTION FIXED TO BPM

_Add other cars
_Add obastacles

_set up dodge
	_perfect dodge (hitboxes on obstacles)
_add boost/ jump


_add boostchain mechanic
_breaklight particles (use motion trails)
	-add hitboxes
